# Module5_Challenge: Financial Planning Tool

## Financial Planning Tool

The Financial Planning Tool application looks for two things from a credit union member. The first part looks at credit union members savings and determines if they have enough to set aside for emergencies. The second part utilizes the Monte Carlo simulation to forecast a retirement portfolio to see which one is best for the credit union member.

## Technologies

This was run on a pc using Windows 10

This project leverages python 3.8.8 with the following packages:


* [os module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) - This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.

* [request](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/requests) - Makes request in python.

* [JSON](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) - Used to transfer data as text. Used by APIs and Databases.

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs) - For manipulating the DataFrame.

* [dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) - Reads key-value pairs from .env file that can be set as environment variables.

* [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io.en/stable) - For code and visualizations.

* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Used to create static, animate, and interactive visualizations in Python.

* [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/) - For scientific computing with python

* [Alpaca Trade API](https://alpaca.markets/docs/) - Used to get API data to run within the application

* [Monte Carlo Simulation](https://github.com/pythonprogramming/monte-carlo-simulator) - Used to access the risk of a given trading strategy

## Installation Guide

In gitbash after you have activated your dev environment, install the following:

```python
  pip install jupyter lab
```

*Anaconda requests

    `conda install -c anaconda request`

## Examples
The images below show the different types of charts and graphs that should result from running the code in the Financial Planning with APIs and Simulations. By reviewing the charts and graphs we can conclude the best outcome for the credit unit members.

## Usage

This section should include screenshots, code blocks, or animations explaining how to use your project.

From the command line you enter jupyter. Make sure you launch Jupyter lab to allow it to seed hidden files for your .env file.

![command line jupyter lab](https://github.com/mckayav3/Module5_Challenge/blob/main/Images/launch_jupyterlab.JPG)

Once the application is launched in Jupyter Lab you run through the code blocks to get your data.

Once all the cell blocks for the Financial Planning with APIs and Simulations have been run you can make your analysis of the data.
