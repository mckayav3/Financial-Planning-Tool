##







## Technologies

This was run on a pc using Windows 10

This project leverages python 3.8.8 with the follwing packages:

* [os module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) - This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.

* [request](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/requests) - Makes request in python.

* [JSON](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) - Used to transfer data as text. Used by APIs and Databases.

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs) - For manipulating the DataFrame.

* [dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) - Reads key-value pairs from .env file that can be set as environment variables.

* [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io.en/stable) - For code and visualizations.

* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Used to create static, animate, and interactive visualizations in Python.

* [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/) - For scientific computing with python

* [Alpaca Trade API](https://alpaca.markets/docs/) - Used to get API data to run within the application

* [Monte Carlo Simulation](https://github.com/pythonprogramming/monte-carlo-simulator) - Used to access the risk of a given trading strategy

## Examples
The images below show the different types of charts and graphs that should result from running the code in the Financial Planning with APIs and Simulations. By reviewing the charts and graphs we can come to a conclusion of the best outcome for the credit unit members.

## Usage

This section should include screenshots, code blocks, or animations explaining how to use your project.

From the command line you enter jupyter. 

![command line jupyter lab](images/command_line_jupyter_lab.JPG)

Once the application is launched in Jupyter Lab you run through the code blocks to get your data.


Once all the cell blocks for the Financial Planning With APIs and Simulations have been run you can make your analysis of the data.
